          Public Protection Unit Database
        </h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">From May - June 2020, a Discovery into the existing Public Protection Unit Database (PPUD) was undertaken to explore what would be required for PPUD to become a modern, flexible, supportable, and user-centred service that:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
  <li>enables the effective and secure release and recall of offenders</li>
<li>diverts patients to the mental health system</li>
<li>supports the investigation of complaints and fatal incidents in justice settings</li>
        </ul>

A number of significant issues were identified with the existing service that led to a recommendation that the monolithic PPUD service be deprecated and replaced by a number of modern services, centred around the outcomes that each organisation using PPUD is trying to achieve, built according to modern technology standards. 

        <p class="govuk-body">These new services should be hosted, maintained and supported by the MoJâ€™s Digital Studio.</p>
